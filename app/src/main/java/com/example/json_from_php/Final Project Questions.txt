BASIC PROJECT GUIDELINES
1. Connect to the php database
2. Create a button to get data from the dB (name, Id, etc.)
3. present this data to a list in the phone
4. create another screen to get a full line of data from the user
5. create a button to insert the above data to the php database
6. create a screen with an input text to search directly into the php db and
    fetch the results to a list on the phone
7. create a button to search into the phones database. the results should be
    send via another button to the sql database
8. All the above should have different screens. All of them should be
accessible via buttons from the main screen

9. Finally, the student have to create a button to fully synchronize the two databases:
This can be done in various ways. Every student has to decide how to do that.
For example, one could decide to send data from local to remote, then delete the local and bring the remote dB over.
Or one can compare each dB line and decide whether to copy/update/delete
